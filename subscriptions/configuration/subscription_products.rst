Subscription products
=====================

Subscription products are required to create a quotation and continue the sales flow regarding your
subscriptions. Indeed, after conceiving your :doc:`subscription_templates`, you will have to create
your subscription products in order to be able to suggest your customer an interesting offer.

Create your first subscription products
=======================================

Go to :menuselection:`Subscriptions → Subscription products`. There, you will have the possibility
to create a new template or edit an existing one. Once named, be careful to select the option
**Can be sold** and deselect **Can be purchased**. For the product type, it is recommended to use
**Service** for subscription products. After that, you can adapt your price and also add an internal
reference.

.. note::
   In the sales tab, underneath the subscriptions section, you can be sure that the subscription
   products option is selected. In fact, if you create the subscription product from the
   **Subscriptions** application, it will be selected by default. However, if you create the product
   from another application, this will not be the case.
